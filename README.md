This is a project that was created by [Chris](https://github.com/chrisgalet18), [Eric](https://github.com/ericverzel) and [I](https://github.com/Tamy-Tam) during our last 2 weeks of the intensive web development 🤓 bootcamp of [Le Wagon Marseille](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/le-wagon-marseille/) 🚀

The idea was that nowadays people tend to study *a lot* via internet tools such as Youtube . These tutos, while very informative, tend to sometimes be ... to informative *not* to take notes. Espeacially in web development. 

As such, we decided to create this web application so we would be able to takes notes📝, all while watching our video. In the **same** place. 

🖥 We have also deployed our site [here](www.unotes.xyz). 





Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
